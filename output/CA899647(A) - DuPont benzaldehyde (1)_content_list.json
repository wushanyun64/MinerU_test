When crystallization occurs in large containers as, for example, in a 30-gallon drum in a warehouse, such crystals form dense, thick layers at the bottom of the drum. It is usually impractical or at least very difficult to re-establish a homogeneous solution even when the contents of the drum are warmed. It was, therefore, believed that dry formulations such as wettable powders and granules, in spite of their hazards, were the most acceptable type of formulations for this combination of herbicides. It has now been discovered that a formulation of linuron and propachlor when combined at a weight ratio of linuron to propachlor of from l:l to l:3 and dissolved   \nin a suitable solvent are surprisingly stable when   \nstored at low temperatures. Formulations as hereinafter described have better low-temperature. storage characteristics than either active constituent at the concentration of said constituent in the mixture with an especially surprising Increase in linuron stability. It has, therefore, been   \ndiscovered that combining linuron and propachlor in a liquid system results in a synergistic depression of the cloud point of the system and enhancement of the low-temperature storage characteristics. The term \"low-temperature\" will be understood to refer to temperatures in the range of $\\circ^{\\circ}$ to $5^{\\circ_{\\mathtt{C}}}$   \nand lower.

In practice, to avoid supercooling effects, cloud points are usually measured by cooling a solution further, to obtain a copious crop of crystals.· The solution'is slowly warmed and the temperature at which the crystals finally disappear is determined.

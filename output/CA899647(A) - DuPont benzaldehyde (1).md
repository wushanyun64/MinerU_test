Linuron and propachlor are herbicides that have each found wide application in weed control programs. It is also known that combinations of linuron and propachlor exhibit outstanding weed control in corn, sorghum and soybeans both in pre-emergence and post-emergence applications.  

These herbicides have been prepared for use either as granules or as wettable powders. Because of the irritatIng and toxic nature of propachlor, the dustiness of dry formulations such as wettable powders represents not only an irritation, but also an actual hazard to persons carelessly handling these formulations. This hazard is of particular importance in the manufacture of wettable powders where the requirement of dust-tight equipment increases the cost and difficulty· of producing the formulation. The properties of both linuron and propachlor are such that a solution concentrate of either ingredient is difficult to produce.  

Agricultural weed killers, like many other formulated products, must meet a variety of exacting requirements before they are commercially useful. In the case of liquid formu..lations, they must be stable in storage. Concentrates for application in water must emulsify weil when diluted at many different concentrations with water of different types and hardness.  

# 899647  

It is known that solution concentrates of   
linuron or of propachlor, at economically practical concentrations, are not stable to cold temperature storage.   
Crystals of the active ingredient will form in said   
concentrates of linuron or sf propachlor at even   
moderately low temperatures. When crystallization occurs in large containers as, for example, in a 30-gallon drum in a warehouse, such crystals form dense, thick layers at the bottom of the drum. It is usually impractical or at least very difficult to re-establish a homogeneous solution even when the contents of the drum are warmed. It was, therefore, believed that dry formulations such as wettable powders and granules, in spite of their hazards, were the most acceptable type of formulations for this combination of herbicides. It has now been discovered that a formulation of linuron and propachlor when combined at a weight ratio of linuron to propachlor of from l:l to l:3 and dissolved   
in a suitable solvent are surprisingly stable when   
stored at low temperatures. Formulations as hereinafter described have better low-temperature. storage characteristics than either active constituent at the concentration of said constituent in the mixture with an especially surprising Increase in linuron stability. It has, therefore, been   
discovered that combining linuron and propachlor in a liquid system results in a synergistic depression of the cloud point of the system and enhancement of the low-temperature storage characteristics. The term "low-temperature" will be understood to refer to temperatures in the range of $\circ^{\circ}$ to $5^{\circ_{\mathtt{C}}}$   
and lower. For practical purposes, a formulation which is stable at a temperature of from $0^{\circ}$ to $5^{\circ_{\mathtt{C}}}$ .will be sufficientl  

# 899647  

stable to withstand the coldest temperatures encountered under normal storage conditions.  

The practice of this invention also results in lower manufacturing costs as the liquid formulations herein claimed can be prepared by dissolving the herbicidal components and agricultural modifiers in simple equipment, moreover dust contamination is not a hazard. In addition, the user of the formulation finds it easy to measure and pour the formulations of this invention with minimum skin exposure and no risk of breathing the dusts inherent in the handling of wettable powders.  

# Summary of the Invention  

This invention relates to novel liquid formulations containing linuron, propachlor, and a solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon or a halocarbon. The formulations of this invention will contain from $15-50\%$ by weight active ingredient. The active ingredient : consists of a combination of linuron and propachlor in which the linuron to propachlor weight ratio is from l:l to l:3. The.preferred formulations of this invention also include an emulsifying agent. In addition, the formulations of this invention can include a co-solvent and an oil-soluble corrosion inhibitor. Preferred co-solvents are alkylbenzenesulfonic acids such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid, nonylbenzenesulfonic acid and phenolic compounds such as phenol, the cresols and resorcinol.· Such co-solvents can comprise up to $40\%$ of the total solvent present in the formulation.  

Detailed Description of the Invention  

As indicated above, the active ingredient is a 30 mixture of linuron and propachlor. The linuron component of  

# 899647  

the formulations of this invention can be prepared by reacting N,0-dimethylhydroxylamine with 3, $\mathfrak{L}$ -dichlorophenyl isocyanate as described in U.S. Patent No. 2,960,534. The propachlor component of the formulation of this invention can be prepared by reacting the acid chloride of $\pmb{\upalpha}$ -haloacetic acid with N-isopropylaniline according to the method taught in-U. S. Patent 2,683,752.  

As discussed above, the active ingredient will be present in an amount of $15\%$ by weight of the total weight of the composition with a concentration of from $25-45\%$ by weight being preferred.  

The $15\%$ by weight lower limit is not critical for obtaining stable formulations, since a lesser amount of. active in the formulation would be operable, but this limitation is set because less concentrated formulations would be uneconomic.  

As the upper limit of $50\%$ by weight 1s approached, the low-temperature stability of the composition becomes the limiting factor. In general, it is not possible to produce compositions containing more than $50\%$ active ingredient and at the same time maintain freedom from crystal formation at the very low temperatures 'occasionally encountered in practical storage of agricultural chemicals.  

The emulsifiable liquid formulations of this invention are preferred. They will contain from about 24 to $84\%$ by weight halocarbon or aromatic hydrocarbon as the solvent. $\yen123,45$ will be understood that the term aromatic hydrocarbon solvent as used. herein includes compounds such as alkylated benzenes, alkylated .naphthalenes and the like; with the limitation that said solvents are within the distillation range of from.about $132^{\circ}-372^{\circ}C$ , are comprised of.greater than $80\%$ aromatics and have a flash point .above $\pmb{z}6^{\bullet}\mathtt{c}$  

# 899647  

Commercially available aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as the following are suitable for use in preparing the formulations of this invention.  

"Espesol"\* #5 (Mfd. by Signal 0il and Gas Co.)   
"Panasol"\* AN-3 (a high-boiling naphtha Mfd. by Amoco Chemicals Corp.)   
Harrett Industrial Xylol (Mfd._by Allied Chemical and Dye Corp.)   
Sinclair Xylol (Mfd. by Sinclair Chemicals Inc.)   
"Picco"\* Hi Solv. 30 (Mfd. by Penn Industrial Chemicals Corp.)   
"velsicol"\* Ar-60 (Mfd. by Velsicol Corp.)   
"velsicol"\* AR-4o (Mfd. by Velsicol Corp.)  

It will be understood that the term halocarbon solvent as used herein includes normally liquid, partially halogenated aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons.  

Of the many aromatic halocarbon solvents available chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene and bromobenzene are preferred because of their economy and their low temperature solvency.  

Of the many aliphatic halocarbon solvents available, those containing from one to three carbon atoms, at least one hydrogen atom and two or more halogen atoms per molecule are preferred. Particularly suitable for a balance of properties are chloroform; 1,l,2-trichloroethane; 1,l,2,2-tetrachloroethane; pentachloroethane and trichloroethylene.  

It will also be understood that the solvent system can be a mixture comprised of one or more aromatic hydrocarbon solvents and one or more halocarbon solvents to achieve the balance of properties desired.

In a liquid formulation intended for direct lowvolume application, the solvent may have greater water-solubility than can be tolerated in an emulsifiable concentrate. Thus an additional group of solvents can be used for such a purpose. The solvents described above for emulsifiable concentrates are still practical and most preferred. Additional highly preferred solvents are N-methylpyrrolidone, benzaldehyde, "Cellosolve"\*, and dimethylformamide. Other preferred solvents are:

anisole   
isoamyl alcohol   
l,3-butylene glycol   
ethylene glycol, methyl ether, acetate   
diethylene glycol, butyl ether   
diethylene glycol, butyl ether, acetate   
cyclohexanone

2-chloroethanol  

In addition, many suitable solvents useful for preparing the formulations of this invention are listed in I. Mellan, Handbook of Solvents, Reinhold Publishing Company，1957.  

\* denotes trade mark  

# 899647  

In addition to the solvent system, it is sometimes advantageous that up to 4o% of the solvent be replaced with a co-solvent. The compounds suitable for incorporation as co-solvents are highly polar materials such as methanol, dimethylformamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, furfural, alkylamines, nitrobenzene, phenolic compounds and alkylbenzenesulfonic acids.  

Of the above-described co-solvents, the alkylbenzenesulfonic acids and phenolic compounds are preferred.  

Preferred formulations of this invention will include as a co-solvent from $5-25\%$ by weight of alkylbenzenesulfonic acids such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid or nonylbenzenesulfonic acid in place of a corresponding amount of solvent.  

Also preferred are formulations containing from 5 to $25\%$ of phenolic co-solvent. Preferred phenolic co-solvents are mono- and dihydroxybenzenes optionally substituted with lower alkyl or halogen. Particularly preferred for low cost and high efficiency as co-solvents are phenol, the cresols, and resorcinol. The phenolic co-solvents need not be in a highly pure state. For example, a typical technical cresol containing $54\%$ m-cresol, and 29% p-cresol also contains $17\%$ other phenols which product is beneficial as a cosolvent.  

In order to make the formulations of this invention useful in aqueous sprays for weed control on corn, sorghum and soybeans, the formulation must contain an emulsifying agent. In some instances, the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid co-solvent can function as the emulsifying agent. In the absence of, or in addition to, an alkylbenzenesulfonic acid co-solvent a conventional emulsifying agent can be present in an amount  

# 899647  

Of $\mathbf{2-1}0\%$ by weight of the formulation. Many suitable emulsifying agents are listed in McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual, l967. Anionic, cationic and nonionic emulsifiers can be used, but anionic and nonionic emulsifiers are preferred. Suitable emulsifying agents include:  

Alkali metal, alkaline earth, and amine salts of alkylarylsulfonic acids.  

Alkylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanols  

Alkoxypolyethoxy ethanol phosphates  

Alkylphenoxy polyethoxy ethanol phosphates  

Polyoxyethylene amines  

Polyethoxylated alkyl alcohols  

Polyethyleneoxide adducts of fatty acids and rosin acids  

Petroleum sulfonates  

Polyethoxylated vegetable oil  

Polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters  

Polyoxyethylene sorbitol fatty acid esters  

Polyoxyethylene glycerol fatty acid esters  

Polyoxyethylene adducts to long-chain mercaptans.  

Mixtures of emulsifying agents such as the ones listed above are often used and are frequently preferred.  

In addition, it may be.desirable to include a small amount of an oil-soluble corrosion inhibitor in the formula.tions of this invention.  

This discussion has concerned itself with a description of liquid herbicidal formulations of linuron and propachlor which are surprisingly stable at low temperatures.  

It has also been discovered that mixtures of linuron 30 witn 2-chloro-2',6:-diethyl-N-(methoxymethyl)acetanilide exhibit similar enhanced solubility. For example at a l:l ratio of  

# 899647  

actives in an aromatic naphtha:methanol system the cloud point of the mixture is surprisingly decreased well below the cloud point of linuron alone in the same system.  

Low-temperature stability limits can be measured by storing samples in a controlled temperature chest, seeding with tiny crystals of pure materials and observing the growth or disappearance of crystals after a period of several days. If no crystals form, the process is then repeated at a lower temperature, until the limit of stability has been found. However, lov-temperature characteristics can be also meaningfully, rapidly and conveniently measured by a determination of the cloud point of the system.  

A cloud point is the equilibrium temperature at which solids first separate from a previously clear solution. For example, if a solution has a cloud point of ${5}^{\circ}{0}$ ·，then a solution which is cooled to $5^{\circ}$ Would be expected to have the first solids and be'in equilibrium with saturated solution. In practice, to avoid supercooling effects, cloud points are usually measured by cooling a solution further, to obtain a copious crop of crystals.· The solution'is slowly warmed and the temperature at which the crystals finally disappear is determined. Using this technique, it has been found that solutions. of propachlor or linuron singly have higher cloud points than the solutions of the combination. .-Generally, the ·formulations of this invention will have a cloud point of ${\mathfrak{s}}^{\bullet}{\mathfrak{c}}$ . or lower with those formulations being preferred which have a cloud point below $\circ^{\bullet}\mathtt{c}$ .It vill, of course, be understood that the stability requirements for a particular formulation will be contingent on the time of year the formulation is shipped, length of storage planned, and geographic destination of the formulation. Usually a  

# 899647  

cloud point of about $5^{\circ}{\mathtt{C}}$ . is acceptable although a formulation with a lower cloud point will be employed when the formulation is to be shipped or stored in cold climates during the winter season.  

To further illustrate the low temperature stability of a linuron-propachlor-solvent system a cold storage test can be run. This type of test differs from the cloud point determination in that equilibrium conditions are attained in the cold storage system, while a dynamic aspect is present in a cloud point determination.  The cold storage test for solution stability is run as follows:  

Purified linuron, purified propachlor and commercial "Triclene"\*, technical (trichloroethylene, technical) are used in the procedure. Samples containing various ratios and concentrations of linuron, propachlor and linuron-propachlor mixtures are placed in a cold chest. The temperature is lowered and samples are seeded with traces of dust of the active ingredients after the solution has been cooled to the test temperature of $-5^{\circ}{\mathtt{C}}$ . The samples are then observed over the course of at least 3 to $\boldsymbol{\downarrow}$ days to determine whether crystailization has occurred. When the temperature of the system is maintained within the range of $-4.5^{\circ}$ to $\mathbf{-5.0^{\circ}C}$ .for four days after seeding the following results are observed:  

# 899647

\*The propachlor ratio appears low because the selected ratio ties the propachlor concentration to the linuron concentration and therefore the propachlor concentration does not appear high when the formuation becomes unstable. However, even at a l:l ratio the combination results in a $30\%$ increase in linuron solubility in the formulation while the above data further shows that the linuron content of the 3:l solution can be increased $40\%$ beyond what is possible in a system not containing propachlor.

The corpositions of this invcntion can be used to selectively control weeds in crops, particularly corn, sorghum and soybeans. The compositions can be applied at rates of 1 to six kilograms per hectare. The exact rate to be used will depend upon the crop, the soil type, the climate and the weeds to be controlled. The treatment will control both broad leaved weeds and grasses. The exact rate to be used can be readily selected by one skilled in the art from the available literature.
